            Working with social, topical, financial, transportation, biological,
            and other networks requires a better understanding of their
            structure and properties. Standard network visualizations of such
            large real-world networks often resemble hairballs that provide
            little actionable insight. This project aims to design, implement,
            and deploy efficient algorithms for multi-level network
            representations that support interactive exploration by general
            audiences. Using the familiar Google map metaphor, these algorithms
            will make it easy to identify important nodes, major pathways, and
            clusters across multiple levels. Unlike existing methods for
            visualizing multi-level networks based on meta-nodes and meta-edges,
            the new visualizations will provide real nodes (prototypes) and real
            paths (backbones) for each level, similar to geographic maps that
            show real cities and real roads at every level of
            detail.<br/><br/>The proposed work contributes to graph algorithms
            by designing and implementing novel and efficient algorithms for
            interactive analysis and visualization of large, multi-level
            networks, information visualization with new methods for multi-level
            network visualization based on the familiar map metaphor, and
            science mapping standards by providing effective means to explore
            and use large-scale, multi-level science maps of our collective
            scholarly knowledge as well as workforce needs. The first goal is to
            design efficient algorithms for computing Multi-Level Graph Spanners
            (MLGS) in support of visual analytics tasks for large network
            exploration, navigation, and communication. The second goal is to
            utilize the MLGS representation in the context of network analysis
            and visualization by building a novel online visualization service
            for interacting with large networks, which combines the MLGS
            approach with clustering, layout and map-like visualization. The
            third goal is to develop a new approach for science and workforce
            classification, lookup, and topical mapping service by applying the
            MLGS approach to the Web of Science publication data (64 million
            publications and 1 billion citations) to compute a multi-level map
            of scientific development. The fourth goal is to validate the new
            algorithms and visualizations by evaluating both the algorithms and
            the system using quantitative and qualitative metrics.<br/><br/>This
            award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
            support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit
            and broader impacts review criteria.

            Understanding complex networked systems is key to solving some of
            the most vexing problems confronting humankind, from discovering how
            dynamic brain connections give rise to thoughts and behaviors, to
            detecting and preventing the spread of misinformation or unhealthy
            behaviors across a population. Graduate training, however, typically
            occurs in one of two dimensions: experimental and observational
            methods in a specific area such as biology and sociology, or in
            general methodologies such as machine learning and data science. 
            With more and more students seeking to gain sufficient expertise in
            mathematical and computational methods on top of domain-specific
            laboratory and social analysis methodologies, a greater demand for
            more efficient training is emerging. This National Science
            Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Indiana University
            will address this growing need with an integrated dual PhD program
            that trains students to be "bidisciplinary" in Complex Networks and
            Systems (CNS) and another discipline of their choosing from the
            natural and social sciences. It will seamlessly integrate
            traditional education with interdisciplinary hands-on research in a
            culture of academic and human diversity. This program will provide
            unique interdisciplinary training for thirty-four (34) PhD students,
            including twenty-two (22) funded trainees. The program will provide
            additional training experience to 40 summer affiliate students and a
            population of more than 300 participants across the participating
            PhD programs.<br/><br/>The training program capitalizes on the new
            Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI). The Institute's
            165+ faculty members will serve in interdisciplinary PhD program
            committees to be co-chaired by research mentors from both CNS and
            the target empirical domain. Project-driven, team-based research at
            IUNI will seamlessly integrate academic education with
            interdisciplinary hands-on scientific and industrial research.
            Trainees will learn to connect the general-purpose, computational
            expertise of CNS to the deep, domain-specific research methodologies
            of the natural, behavioral, and social sciences thus bridging the
            gap between distinct training cultures. They will be a new breed of
            STEM scientists that escapes the silos of disciplinary training to
            address the complex problems of the 21st century. Specifically, the
            four goals of training activity are: 1) provide dual research
            proficiency; 2) develop collaborative skills via early integration
            into problem-driven, interdisciplinary research; 3) produce a
            diverse workforce by recruiting student cohorts from a broad set of
            disciplines and varied backgrounds to be trained within a team
            culture; 4) establish a sustainable interdisciplinary training model
            by enlarging the institutional channels created between informatics
            and natural and social sciences to other Indiana University
            departments and institutions. A science-of-science study conducted
            throughout the NRT project will evaluate the efficacy of
            interdisciplinary training of the students in this program. This
            project will develop a flexible dual PhD program and best-practices
            to allow additional departments at Indiana University to join the
            program in the future, as well as other institutions to develop
            similar programs.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT)
            Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation
            of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate
            education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective
            training of STEM graduate students in high priority
            interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship
            models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with
            changing workforce and research needs.

            As the world is increasingly dependent upon computing and
            computational processes associated with data analysis, it is
            essential to gain a better understanding of the visualization
            technologies that are used to make meaning of massive scientific
            data. It is also essential that the infrastructure, the very means
            by which technologies are developed for improving the public's
            engagement in science itself, be better understood. Thus, this AISL
            Innovations in Development project will address the critical need
            for the public to learn how to interpret and understand highly
            complex and visualized scientific data. The project will design,
            develop and study a new technology platform, xMacroscope, as a
            learning tool that will allow visitors at the Science Museum of
            Minnesota and the Center of Science and Industry, to create, view,
            understand, and interact with different data sets using diverse
            visualization types. The xMacroscope will support rapid research
            prototyping of public experiences at selected exhibits, such as
            collecting data on a runner's speed and height and the visualized
            representation of such data. The xMacroscope will provide research
            opportunities for exhibit designers, education researchers, and
            learning scientists to study diverse audiences at science centers in
            order to understand how learning about data through the xMacroscope
            tool may inform definitions of data literacy. The research will
            advance the state of the art in visualization technology, which will
            have broad implications for teaching and learning of scientific data
            in both informal and formal learning environments. The project will
            lead to better understanding by science centers on how to present
            data to the public more effectively through visualizations that are
            based upon massive amounts of data. Technology results and research
            findings will be disseminated broadly through professional
            publications and presentations at science, education, and technology
            conferences. The project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM
            Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to,
            and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of
            STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing
            multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM
            learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and
            assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing
            understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>The
            project is driven by the assumption that in the digital information
            age, being able to create and interpret data visualizations is an
            important literacy for the public. The research will seek to define,
            measure, and advance data visualization literacy. The project will
            engage the public in using the xMacrocope at the Science Museum of
            Minnesota and at the Center of Science and Industry's (COSI) science
            museum and research center in Columbus, Ohio. In both museum
            settings the public will interact with different datasets and
            diverse types of visualizations. Using the xMacroscope platform,
            personal attributes and capabilities will be measured and
            personalized data visualizations will be constructed. Existing
            theories of learning (constructivist and constructionist) will be
            extended to capture the learning and use of data visualization
            literacy. In addition, the project team will conduct a meta-review
            related to different types of literacy and will produce a definition
            with performance measures to assess data visualization literacy -
            currently broadly defined in the project as the ability to read,
            understand, and create data visualizations. The research has
            potential for significant impact in the field of science and
            technology education and education research on visual learning. It
            will further our understanding of the nature of data visualization
            literacy learning and define opportunities for visualizing data in
            ways that are both personally and culturally meaningful. The project
            expects to advance the understanding of the role of personalization
            in the learning process using iterative design-based research
            methodologies to advance both theory and practice in informal
            learning settings. An iterative design process will be applied for
            addressing the research questions by correlating visualizations to
            individual actions and contributions, exploring meaning-making
            studies of visualization construction, and testing the xMacroscope
            under various conditions of crowdedness and busyness in a museum
            context. The evaluation plan is based upon a logic model and the
            evaluation will iteratively inform the direction, process, and
            productivity of the project.

            Understanding the value of campus-based cyberinfrastructure (CI) to
            the institutions that invest in such CI is intrinsically difficult. 
            Given today's financial pressure, administrative support for
            campus-based CI centers offering resources to local campus users is
            under constant budgetary pressure.  This is partly due to the
            difficulty in obtaining quantitative metrics that clearly
            demonstrate the utility of investment in campus CI centers in
            enhancing scientific research and the financial aspects of enhanced
            competitive ability in seeking funding for research.  <br/><br/>This
            proposal seeks to implement a set of highly experimental modules to
            be added to the existing CI metrics tool eXtreme Data Metrics on
            Demand (XDMoD).  These modules are intended to provide a means for
            assessing campus-based CI investment in scientific terms, as
            measured in publications, and in financial terms, as measured in
            grant income from researchers who use CI as compared to those who do
            not.  The modules, tentatively called Open XDMoD Value Analytics,
            will present a view of financial, collaboration, and publication
            data, showing "return-on-investment" metrics in relation to CI
            usage.  The goal of the work is to generalize these modules to work
            with a variety of funding and publication information sources, and
            incorporate them into the open source distribution of Open XDMoD.

            The International Workshop entitled "The Role of Social Network
            Research in Enabling Cyberinfrastructure and the Role of
            Cyberinfrastructure in Enabling Social Network Research" brings
            together leading researchers and practitioners in social network
            analysis with key scientists and engineers who are in the process of
            developing cyberinfrastructure for their respective communities. The
            Workshop will help acquaint the scientific and engineering community
            with the potential of social networking tools to enhance the
            communication and knowledge networks within the communities
            supported by cyberinfrastructure. Traditionally, social network
            analysis has focused on small and "single mode" or bimodal
            affiliation networks. The workshop will help the social network
            analysis community in identifying a research agenda for extending
            existing theory, methodology, and computational tools to enable
            large-scale and multidimensional networks. By bringing together
            leading social network researchers and leading developers of
            cyberinfrastructure in diverse science and engineering communities,
            the Workshop will also promote: (i) the specification of new
            mathematical and statistical models with broad application in the
            social and behavioral sciences, (ii) the development and extension
            of scalable algorithms to analyze and visualize the large scale and
            multidimensional networks that exist within these cybercommunities,
            and (iii) the development and extension of advanced user-driven
            software and web services that implement these algorithms to help
            members of a cybercommunity leverage their communication and
            knowledge networks. <br/>Broader impacts: The Workshop will offer a
            unique means for a symbiotic exchange of insights between the social
            network analysis research community (which cuts across many
            disciplines, but especially sociology, psychology, communication,
            organizational science, information science and economic) and the
            key developers of cyberinfrastructure (which cuts across many
            disciplines including atmospheric sciences, geo sciences,
            environmental engineering, ecological research, and public health).
            The Workshop will help network scholars and students identify the
            challenges as well as the opportunities of social networking to
            enable research and education within a cyberinfrastructure. This
            will result in a direct transfer of knowledge and results from the
            fields of specialist social network research to wider scientific
            communities exploring the development of cyberinfrastructure in
            their fields. The workshop will also assess the viability and
            contours of developing a Social Network Analysis Cyberinfrastructure
            for advancing network analysis, modeling, visualization research and
            education. The broad mix of researchers from these various
            communities has the potential to unleash a new generation of theory,
            education, and practice on the role of social networking and 21st
            century cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>

            This pathways project will study how audiences in public spaces, in
            this case those in a museum setting, relate to and make sense of
            large data displays. The project is preliminary to development of a
            traveling, hands-on exhibition enabling users to create and utilize
            representations of big data displays such as maps and charts.  As
            the test case, the project will use science maps that provide an
            overview of science generally and specific areas of STEM, charting
            and exploring the history and future of science and technology. The
            data collection portion of the project will take place at the New
            York Hall of Science, the Marian Koshland Science Museum, COSI in
            Columbus, Ohio, and WonderLab Museum in Bloomington, Indiana.
            <br/><br/>The project will create a foundation for the design of
            museum exhibits and educational programs that teach museum visitors
            how to explore, engage and make better sense of big data. The
            project is potentially transformative because big data is becoming
            ubiquitous and making sense out of large data displays is necessary
            in order to understand big data sets.

            Network Science," to be held at Indiana University, Bloomington,
            Indiana, during May 2006.  The primary objective of these activities
            is to facilitate interactions among social and behavioral scientists
            and the many new disciplines interested in and utilizing network
            science.  The Workshop and Conference will bring together leading
            researchers and practitioners in network science --- analysts,
            modeling experts, and visualization specialists --- with graduate
            students from many different research areas for interdisciplinary
            communication and collaboration.  The Workshop will feature
            tutorials focusing on a variety of network science research areas. 
            The Workshop will lead into the Conference, which will feature
            intellectual discourses and conference presentations from the
            invited graduate students.<br/><br/>For network research to achieve
            its potential impact on scientific research, students and faculty
            need to be broadly trained in this area, learning not only the basic
            measurement and modeling tools but also their meaning and range of
            applicability.  The Workshop will provide cross training in the
            theory and methods of network science, incorporating the
            perspectives of diverse disciplines such as sociology,
            organizational science, information science, mathematics,
            statistics, informatics, biology, and physics.  By bringing together
            leading researchers and emerging network scholars, the Workshop and
            the Conference will also promote the development of new mathematical
            and statistical models with broad application in the social and
            behavioral sciences.  Dissemination products include an easily
            accessible website containing tutorials and invited and contributed
            papers.  This award was supported as part of the fiscal year 2005
            Mathematical Sciences priority area special competition on
            Mathematical Social and Behavioral Sciences (MSBS). <br/>

            This award supports the "Visualizing Network Dynamics" Competition
            intended to cull some of the world's best dynamic network
            visualization results to be exhibited at the 2007 International
            Workshop and Conference on Network Science (NetSci07), held in the
            New York Hall of Science, May 20 - 25, 2007.<br/><br/>The
            competition is designed to attract researchers, practitioners, and
            educators from such diverse disciplines as anthropology, sociology,
            history, social psychology, political science, human geography,
            biology, economics, communications science but also art and design
            to submit the best-of visualizations of evolving networks, activity
            patterns over networks or combinations of the two. Competition
            applications comprise of large resolution static images or video
            footage together with a detailed explanation of datasets used,
            analysis or modeling techniques applied, and the visualization
            design. Applicants are also asked to list and explain major insights
            gained and to discuss the value the visualization may have for
            educational purposes.<br/><br/>The competition plans to feature the
            winning entries that support insight and decision making network
            dynamics visualizations (as opposed to purely artistically appealing
            images or videos). In addition, it aims to raise the bar for the
            documentation and communication of the process applied to generate
            those visualizations, and to sensitize people to the importance of
            visualization for education.<br/><br/>The winning entries will be
            recognized and all valid entries will be made available online via
            the NetSci07 Web site (http://www.nd.edu/%7Enetsci/) as a general,
            free resource for anybody interested in the study or communication
            of dynamic networks. Online dissemination is expected to improve
            diverse network science related scientific, engineering and/or
            educational activities. <br/>

            This project is applying advances in digital library (DL)
            technologies to the emerging domain of bioinformatics, and
            developing interaction tools that support learning based on
            identifying and visualizing associations among key dimensions of
            bioinformatics resources. The project is making these current
            resources, which are mainly utilized by expert biologists, available
            to bioinformatics students. The project addresses issues regarding:
            the use of a wide variety of formats and representations to store
            bioinformatics information; the application of DL technologies
            particularly in the realm of data description and exchange; mapping
            of metadata associated with bioinformatics information to data
            description standards compatible with DL technologies; and building
            clients that take advantage of data dissemination protocols such as
            the Open Archives Initiative in order to support novel browse,
            search, and analysis functions based on visualizations. The project
            team is also integrating DL and Grid computing technologies, and
            utilizes bioinformatics resources of Indiana University such as the
            Drosophila Genome Flybase, the IUBio Archive that contains euGenes
            eukaryote genes data, and the Bionet news archive and related
            software.

            A highly publicized report by the American Cancer Society noted that
            cancer has surpassed heart disease to become the number one killer
            of adults under the age of 85 in the United States today. At the top
            of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is eminently
            preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute,
            system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric
            approaches. For example, when the tobacco research community
            realized it had taken over a decade to discover that they had
            already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed across
            its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light'
            (low-tar/low-nicotine brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to
            nor risk of cancer, researchers began to understand the importance
            of effectively sharing resources and information across the entire
            community. In response, government agencies involved in public
            health have made a substantial foundational investment in developing
            a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems
            integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the
            Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN).
            While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite,
            delays in discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light'
            cigarette mentioned above) have prompted the TSEEN community to
            underscore the need for social network referral tools as a crucial
            component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their
            collaboration system.<br/>

            Knowledge Domain Visualizations (KDVs) are a special kind of
            Information Visualizations (IVs) that exploit powerful human vision
            and spatial cognition to help humans mentally organize and
            electronically access and manage large, complex information spaces.
            Unlike scientific visualizations, KDVs are created from data that
            have no spatial reference, such as publications, patents, or
            grants.<br/>The research component of this project comprises the
            setup of an advanced, open architecture, computing infrastructure
            for KDV education and research as well as the development and
            comprehensive evaluation of algorithms for incremental and scalable
            data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and spatial layout.
            Cartographic principles are employed to facilitate the use of skills
            traditionally associated with geographic maps for the exploration of
            KDVs. <br/>The education plan includes the development of an
            Information Visualization Data and Software Repository that together
            with associated Learning Modules provides public access to and
            training for existing and newly developed IV and KDV software. The
            value of KDVs for educational purposes, e.g., to equip students with
            a "big picture" or global view of teaching material, is
            explored.<br/>The project will make KDVs available as a new
            information access and management tool that has the potential to
            dramatically improve the communication of scientific results for
            students, researchers, agencies, R&D managers, industry, data
            providers, and society; (2) create an advanced computing
            infrastructure for IV/KDV researchers to contribute, run, and
            compare new and existing algorithms on diverse data sets; and (3)
            improve IV/KDV teaching, training and learning by means of an online
            IV/KDV repository, associated learning modules, as well as a
            textbook. <br/><br/>Web page: http://vw.indiana.edu/kdv<br/><br/>

            Today, mankind's scholarly knowledge is stored in millions of papers
            that are often not the best format to keep track of scientific
            results, in 10,000s of databases that are rarely interlinked, 1,000s
            of software repositories with no central search facility, and of
            course in experts heads distributed around the globe and across the
            landscape of science. Many scientific projects and experiments
            require access not only to results published in papers but also to
            the raw or processed data used, the services/algorithms/tools
            applied, the people which performed the work as the paper might not

            with a dataset/algorithm can be retrieved, etc. <br/><br/>The
            proposed workshop aims to identify the general features of
            cyber-enabled knowledge management tools in support of discovery.
            Specifically, the focus is on two major challenges: <br/>* How to
            better capture and interlink scientific data, algorithms,
            publications, and expertise? <br/>* How to improve access,
            navigation, understanding, and discovery by means of visual
            interfaces to digital resources such as scientific data, algorithms,
            publications, and expertise?<br/>The two challenges and potential
            solutions will be discussed in detail using two application domains
            of major economic and societal importance: science of science
            studies and biomedical research. <br/><br/>The two-day workshop will
            bring together about 20 leading US and international experts in
            databases, digital libraries, cyberinfrastructure/e-Science design,
            social science of cyberinfrastructure, as well as practitioners in
            the areas of science of science studies and biology. The goal of the
            workshop is to identify high impact research directions,
            technological opportunities, synergistic collaborations across
            disciplines and application domains towards more effective knowledge
            management and visualization tools that will support discovery and
            innovation. <br/><br/>Workshop Web site
            (http://vw.indiana.edu/cdi2008) provides relevant material and will
            be used for disseminating the resulting workshop report.

            This project facilitates a unique collaboration among artists and
            scientists with the goal to develop, implement, and validate novel
            metaphors and approaches to access, manage, and communicate
            scholarly datasets. The results are expected to have transformative
            power in terms of the organization, analysis, and visualization of
            large-scale scholarly datasets. A sequence of three artists will
            work with scientists at the Information Visualization Laboratory and
            the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center at Indiana
            University. <br/><br/>The artists will work with database experts on
            parsing, structuring, and loading new datasets into a multi-terabyte
            database of scholarly data. The artists will play with a multitude
            of data analysis and visualization algorithms. They will participate
            in brainstorming, technical, and design sessions. Most importantly,
            the artists will be fully immersed as equal partners in different
            projects. Ethnographic studies will be conducted to capture,
            optimize, and communicate this unique collaboration. This is
            exploratory work as we cannot predict what will happen when artists
            are immersed in the Lab and are asked to rethink and reinvent the
            way in which research is conducted, the tools being used and
            designed by the researchers, and the means of communicating
            results.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this research will be
            facilitated by three workshops that bring together artists and
            scientists with synergistic expertise in (2) the communication of
            science dynamics, (2) novel devices and interactivity techniques,
            and (3) dramatization of information. These workshops bring together
            scholars and artist that normally do not meet in a scholarly
            setting.

            Science policy and other decision makers need qualitatively novel
            tools to help them identify the publications, patents, technology
            claims, grant proposals, or other developments that are most
            important or potentially profitable and deserve their full
            attention. They also need a tool that lets them analyze and mine
            terabytes of relevant data and presents aggregated results in an
            easy to understand way, enabling them to increase the quality of
            their decisions. However, more than just a tool is needed. The
            design of tools that truly support science policy making requires a
            detailed characterization and prioritization of the information
            needs of science policy makers, along with a conceptual framework
            that links the information needs of the policy maker to the
            available data, analysis and indicator types. Once these are in
            place, tool development that truly addresses the needs of today's
            science policy makers given the constraints of existing datasets as
            well as theoretical and algorithmic approaches can proceed.
            <br/>This study addresses three challenges. First, a detailed
            analysis is conducted of the information needs of a representative
            set of science policy makers including existing data, approaches and
            tools. Second, a theoretic conceptualization is developed of tasks
            relevant to science policymaking that maps the needs of policy
            makers to theoretically grounded and practically valuable processing
            pipelines that transform data into actionable information. This
            conceptualization is then made available online in a wiki-like
            format for community review and consensus building. Third, a
            prototypical tool--a macroscope--is designed to visualize structure,
            patterns, trends, and outliers in science and technology data sets
            that are too large and complex to be comprehensible to the
            researchers through direct observation--just like microscopes and
            telescopes make it possible to see things that are too small or too
            far away. The prototypical macroscope supports a well defined set of
            information needs, e.g., identification of emerging research
            frontiers or correlation of funding with publications and patents in
            an area of research and exploration of results using graphs and
            geospatial and science maps. Macroscope tool development will
            benefit from the NSF funded Scholarly Database (SDB)) that provides
            access to more than 20 million scholarly records, and the
            Cyberinfrastructure Shell (CIShell), which supports the easy plug
            and play of datasets and algorithms and the design of stand-alone
            tools. Usability studies are conducted to evaluate and optimize the
            macroscope. The macroscope as well as its support of advanced
            science mapping techniques will be introduced to a broader audience
            by means of the Places and Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit.
            Researchers and science policymakers in Japan will participate in
            this project, generating a bi-directional flow of best theory and
            practice.<br/>The scientific study and management of science and
            technology requires a shared terminology and conceptualization of
            how science works. It requires shared data repositories that can be
            used to run benchmarks and comparisons of algorithms, to thoroughly
            validate the combination of algorithms, indicators, and evaluation
            procedures. The theoretical component of this study, as well as the
            extension of the SDB and the prototypical design of a macroscope,
            will create a basic shared understanding and a freely available
            cyberinfrastructure and tool for the science of science (policy)
            community. <br/>The same capabilities that could make the macroscope
            a tool of choice for science policy makers could also make it
            attractive to other potential users. For instance, students or
            members of the public will be able to see the large scale structures
            of science, and find potential areas of interest for further study;
            researchers will be able to monitor and access research results,
            relevant funding opportunities, or find potential collaborators
            within and without their fields of inquiry. Program managers and
            reviewers will use it to meet their individual needs.

            With support from the Chemistry Division, Professor Katy Borner of
            Indiana University will convert her unique "Places & Spaces: Mapping
            Science" materials into a traveling exhibit in order to make these
            materials more widely available. Building on the success of test
            displays at the new New York City Public Library of Science,
            Industry, and Business (April 3rd - August 31st, 2006) and at the
            New York Hall of Science Children's Museum (on-going), this new
            project will commence with a display at the 233rd National Meeting &
            Exposition of the American Chemical Society in Chicago, IL (March
            25-29, 2007). The exhibit has been very popular and has been widely
            covered in the press (see listing at http://scimaps.org). This
            program will enable this unique exhibit to travel widely and to help
            people to see and understand "science from above."

            This project will design, evaluate, and operate a unique
            distributed, shared resources environment for large-scale network
            analysis, modeling, and visualization, named NetWorkBench (NWB). The
            envisioned data-code-computing resources environment will provide a
            one-stop online portal for researchers, educators, and practitioners
            interested in the study of biomedical, social and behavioral
            science, physics, and other networks.<br/><br/>The NWB will support
            network science research across scientific boundaries. Users of the
            NWB will have online access to major network datasets or can upload
            their own networks. They will be able to perform network analysis
            with the most effective algorithms available. In addition, they will
            be able to generate, run, and validate network models to advance
            their understanding of the structure and dynamics of particular
            networks. NWB will provide advanced visualization tools to
            interactively explore and understand specific networks, as well as
            their interaction with other types of networks. <br/><br/>A major
            computer science challenge is the development of an algorithm
            integration framework that supports the easy integration and
            dissemination of existing and new algorithms and can deal with the
            multitude of network data formats in existence today. Another
            challenge is the design and implementation of an easy to use
            menu-based, online portal interface for interactive algorithm
            selection, data manipulation, user and session management. The NWB
            will be evaluated in diverse research projects and educational
            settings in biology, social and behavioral science, and physics
            research. It will be well documented and available as open source
            for easy duplication and usage at other sites. An annual summer
            school and a series of workshops and tutorials are planned to
            introduce the tool to diverse research communities. <br/><br/>The
            NWB will provide members of the scientific research community at
            large (biologists, physicists, computer scientists, social and
            behavioral scientists, engineers, etc.) with the means to carry out
            network analysis, modeling, and visualization projects in their own
            fields. This will result in a direct transfer of knowledge and
            results from the fields of specialist network research to a wider
            scientific community. Researchers will have access to validated
            algorithms that in the past have been obtained through
            time-consuming personal developments of ad hoc computer programs.
            The NWB is expected to enhance and encourage the empirical analysis
            and model validation of networks, generating an eventual
            acceleration in the development of network science research. Online
            instructional material will support the use of the NWB in
            educational settings. <br/><br/>The NWB will provide a unique tool
            for network science researchers in many disciplines. In effect, NWB
            can deploy the knowledge accumulated in network theory and practice
            across sciences with just one web click to any interested
            researcher, practitioner, or student. The NWB shared resources
            environment will speed up and ease network science applications and
            education in biology, social and behavioral science, and large
            infrastructure analysis, thereby accelerating the rate of scientific
            discovery.

            Professor Katy Boerner of the University of Indiana and Dr. Kevin
            Boyack of Sandia National Laboratories are supported with a Small
            Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) from the Analytical and
            Surface Chemistry Program to study the interconnections between
            chemistry, biochemistry and the life sciences and their evolution in
            time. The idea is to utilize advanced data mining and visualization
            techniques to analyze citation links among papers in the
            approximately 1300 journals related to chemistry, biochemistry and
            the life sciences over the past 30 years. Knowledge domain maps will
            be employed to communicate the growth of both fields of science over
            time as well as their inter-citations patterns. The work plan
            includes data cleaning and parsing, mapping and analyzing the
            structure of the domains, identification of interdisciplinary
            information producers and consumers, diffusion of information
            studies, and validation in cooperation with domain experts in
            chemistry and the life sciences.<br/><br/>This proof-of-concept
            project will create baseline visualizations that show the potential
            of knowledge domain mapping techniques to better inform decisions on
            programs that require accurate knowledge of the current science and
            technology infrastructure. New opportunities in the
            interdisciplinary areas between chemistry and biology merit study in
            order for the research community to evaluate the best next steps.
            This project will support graduate students in a research
            university/research lab collaboration. The activity is timely, as
            the development and utilization of visualizations is facilitated by
            the explosion of information available digitally, the decreasing
            cost of storage and computing power, the development of fast
            graphics processors, as well as expanding connectivity between
            systems.

            CBET-0831636<br/>K. Borner, Indiana University<br/><br/>A new field
            of Sustainability Science and Engineering is emerging that seeks to
            understand the fundamental character of interactions between nature
            and human society and to help steer the impact of humanity's needs
            on the planet's natural resources towards sustainable trajectories.
            Sustainability Science and Engineering is unified in clear terms by
            its ultimate goals but occupies an interdisciplinary position among
            traditional research fields, spanning both science and engineering
            and spreading across disciplines as diverse as agriculture, ecology,
            oceanography, climate studies, economics, a diverse set of social
            sciences, energy and materials and several additional aspects of
            engineering, physics, biology, and chemistry. Although
            Sustainability Science and engineering is by now widely discussed in
            the scientific and engineering community, and is beginning to be
            connected to the political agenda for economic and social
            development, it remains unclear to what extent its many facets are
            being integrated into a global perspective and whether researchers
            are utilizing it as a nexus to collaborate across traditional
            scientific and engineering fields. This project will address such
            issues by delineating, analyzing, and mapping both basic research on
            sustainability. Specifically, a comprehensive dataset of scholarly
            publications, patents, research grants, policy documents and popular
            science pieces that together define the integrated knowledge of the
            field will be compiled. <br/><br/>Analysis results will be presented
            as tables, graphs, and in form of geospatial and science maps.
            Sustainability experts will be invited to interpret these results.
            Findings will be presented, discussed, and disseminated via
            scholarly publications, online, and at a workshop on the topic of
            sustainability. Encouraging timely scientific and engineering
            progress across a large set of traditional disciplines requires
            generating a global perspective (a view 'from above') to determine
            the most effective actions and incentives to be created by
            governments, funding agencies, non-governmental organizations, the
            scientific community, and the public at large. This work will map
            the current state of sustainability science and engineering
            worldwide and provide actionable insights into its future
            development. The resulting maps will be useful for communicating the
            state of the art as well as to point out challenges and
            opportunities. They might be extended and adopted as a visual
            interface into research and practice of Sustainability Science and
            Engineering. Several graduate students will be involved and trained
            in this project.

            Science policy is concerned with the need to allocate resources,
            both monetary and human, in an effective way to foster innovation.
            Advances in computational power combined with the availability of
            big data on science and technology developments create ideal
            conditions for the advancement of computational modeling approaches
            that can be empirically validated and used to understand and predict
            future developments in science, technology, and innovation. The
            conference will apply a systems-science approach to review
            mathematical, statistical, and computational models and discuss the
            creation of an up-to-date inventory of methods and tools available
            to model the future direction of STI.<br/><br/>This conference will
            bring together leading experts from economics, social science,
            scientometrics and bibliometrics, information science, physics, and
            science policy that focus on developing mathematical, statistical,
            and computational models of different types (stochastic,
            agent-based, epidemics, game-theoretic, network. etc.) to increase
            our understanding of the structure and dynamics of science,
            technology, and innovation. The conference will invite participation
            from federal funding, university administrators and other science
            policy makers, to help identify potential grand challenges.

      biological, and other networks requires a better understanding of their
      structure and properties. Standard network visualizations of such large
      real-world networks often resemble hairballs that provide little
      actionable insight. This project aims to design, implement, and deploy
      efficient algorithms for multi-level network representations that support
      interactive exploration by general audiences. Using the familiar Google
      map metaphor, these algorithms will make it easy to identify important
      nodes, major pathways, and clusters across multiple levels. Unlike
      existing methods for visualizing multi-level networks based on meta-nodes
      and meta-edges, the new visualizations will provide real nodes
      (prototypes) and real paths (backbones) for each level, similar to
      geographic maps that show real cities and real roads at every level of
      detail.<br/><br/>The proposed work contributes to graph algorithms by
      designing and implementing novel and efficient algorithms for interactive
      analysis and visualization of large, multi-level networks, information
      visualization with new methods for multi-level network visualization based
      on the familiar map metaphor, and science mapping standards by providing
      effective means to explore and use large-scale, multi-level science maps
      of our collective scholarly knowledge as well as workforce needs. The
      first goal is to design efficient algorithms for computing Multi-Level
      Graph Spanners (MLGS) in support of visual analytics tasks for large
      network exploration, navigation, and communication. The second goal is to
      utilize the MLGS representation in the context of network analysis and
      visualization by building a novel online visualization service for
      interacting with large networks, which combines the MLGS approach with
      clustering, layout and map-like visualization. The third goal is to
      develop a new approach for science and workforce classification, lookup,
      and topical mapping service by applying the MLGS approach to the Web of
      Science publication data (64 million publications and 1 billion citations)
      to compute a multi-level map of scientific development. The fourth goal is
      to validate the new algorithms and visualizations by evaluating both the
      algorithms and the system using quantitative and qualitative
      metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
      deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
      intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

      is key to solving some of the most vexing problems confronting humankind,
      from discovering how dynamic brain connections give rise to thoughts and
      behaviors, to detecting and preventing the spread of misinformation or
      unhealthy behaviors across a population. Graduate training, however,
      typically occurs in one of two dimensions: experimental and observational
      methods in a specific area such as biology and sociology, or in general
      methodologies such as machine learning and data science.  With more and
      more students seeking to gain sufficient expertise in mathematical and
      computational methods on top of domain-specific laboratory and social
      analysis methodologies, a greater demand for more efficient training is
      emerging. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT)
      award to Indiana University will address this growing need with an
      integrated dual PhD program that trains students to be ""bidisciplinary""
      in Complex Networks and Systems (CNS) and another discipline of their
      choosing from the natural and social sciences. It will seamlessly
      integrate traditional education with interdisciplinary hands-on research
      in a culture of academic and human diversity. This program will provide
      unique interdisciplinary training for thirty-four (34) PhD students,
      including twenty-two (22) funded trainees. The program will provide
      additional training experience to 40 summer affiliate students and a
      population of more than 300 participants across the participating PhD
      programs.<br/><br/>The training program capitalizes on the new Indiana
      University Network Science Institute (IUNI). The Institute's 165+ faculty
      members will serve in interdisciplinary PhD program committees to be
      co-chaired by research mentors from both CNS and the target empirical
      domain. Project-driven, team-based research at IUNI will seamlessly
      integrate academic education with interdisciplinary hands-on scientific
      and industrial research. Trainees will learn to connect the
      general-purpose, computational expertise of CNS to the deep,
      domain-specific research methodologies of the natural, behavioral, and
      social sciences thus bridging the gap between distinct training cultures.
      They will be a new breed of STEM scientists that escapes the silos of
      disciplinary training to address the complex problems of the 21st century.
      Specifically, the four goals of training activity are: 1) provide dual
      research proficiency; 2) develop collaborative skills via early
      integration into problem-driven, interdisciplinary research; 3) produce a
      diverse workforce by recruiting student cohorts from a broad set of
      disciplines and varied backgrounds to be trained within a team culture; 4)
      establish a sustainable interdisciplinary training model by enlarging the
      institutional channels created between informatics and natural and social
      sciences to other Indiana University departments and institutions. A
      science-of-science study conducted throughout the NRT project will
      evaluate the efficacy of interdisciplinary training of the students in
      this program. This project will develop a flexible dual PhD program and
      best-practices to allow additional departments at Indiana University to
      join the program in the future, as well as other institutions to develop
      similar programs.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is
      designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new
      potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.
      The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate
      students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through
      comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and
      aligned with changing workforce and research needs."

      the world is increasingly dependent upon computing and computational
      processes associated with data analysis, it is essential to gain a better
      understanding of the visualization technologies that are used to make
      meaning of massive scientific data. It is also essential that the
      infrastructure, the very means by which technologies are developed for
      improving the public's engagement in science itself, be better understood.
      Thus, this AISL Innovations in Development project will address the
      critical need for the public to learn how to interpret and understand
      highly complex and visualized scientific data. The project will design,
      develop and study a new technology platform, xMacroscope, as a learning
      tool that will allow visitors at the Science Museum of Minnesota and the
      Center of Science and Industry, to create, view, understand, and interact
      with different data sets using diverse visualization types. The
      xMacroscope will support rapid research prototyping of public experiences
      at selected exhibits, such as collecting data on a runner's speed and
      height and the visualized representation of such data. The xMacroscope
      will provide research opportunities for exhibit designers, education
      researchers, and learning scientists to study diverse audiences at science
      centers in order to understand how learning about data through the
      xMacroscope tool may inform definitions of data literacy. The research
      will advance the state of the art in visualization technology, which will
      have broad implications for teaching and learning of scientific data in
      both informal and formal learning environments. The project will lead to
      better understanding by science centers on how to present data to the
      public more effectively through visualizations that are based upon massive
      amounts of data. Technology results and research findings will be
      disseminated broadly through professional publications and presentations
      at science, education, and technology conferences. The project is funded
      by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to
      advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design
      and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes
      providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in
      STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment
      of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings
      of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>The project is driven by the
      assumption that in the digital information age, being able to create and
      interpret data visualizations is an important literacy for the public. The
      research will seek to define, measure, and advance data visualization
      literacy. The project will engage the public in using the xMacrocope at
      the Science Museum of Minnesota and at the Center of Science and
      Industry's (COSI) science museum and research center in Columbus, Ohio. In
      both museum settings the public will interact with different datasets and
      diverse types of visualizations. Using the xMacroscope platform, personal
      attributes and capabilities will be measured and personalized data
      visualizations will be constructed. Existing theories of learning
      (constructivist and constructionist) will be extended to capture the
      learning and use of data visualization literacy. In addition, the project
      team will conduct a meta-review related to different types of literacy and
      will produce a definition with performance measures to assess data
      visualization literacy - currently broadly defined in the project as the
      ability to read, understand, and create data visualizations. The research
      has potential for significant impact in the field of science and
      technology education and education research on visual learning. It will
      further our understanding of the nature of data visualization literacy
      learning and define opportunities for visualizing data in ways that are
      both personally and culturally meaningful. The project expects to advance
      the understanding of the role of personalization in the learning process
      using iterative design-based research methodologies to advance both theory
      and practice in informal learning settings. An iterative design process
      will be applied for addressing the research questions by correlating
      visualizations to individual actions and contributions, exploring
      meaning-making studies of visualization construction, and testing the
      xMacroscope under various conditions of crowdedness and busyness in a
      museum context. The evaluation plan is based upon a logic model and the
      evaluation will iteratively inform the direction, process, and
      productivity of the project."

      publications, and in financial terms, as measured in grant income from
      researchers who use CI as compared to those who do not.  The modules,
      tentatively called Open XDMoD Value Analytics, will present a view of
      financial, collaboration, and publication data, showing

      Network Research in Enabling Cyberinfrastructure and the Role of
      Cyberinfrastructure in Enabling Social Network Research"" brings together
      leading researchers and practitioners in social network analysis with key
      scientists and engineers who are in the process of developing
      cyberinfrastructure for their respective communities. The Workshop will
      help acquaint the scientific and engineering community with the potential
      of social networking tools to enhance the communication and knowledge
      networks within the communities supported by cyberinfrastructure.
      Traditionally, social network analysis has focused on small and ""single
      mode"" or bimodal affiliation networks. The workshop will help the social
      network analysis community in identifying a research agenda for extending
      existing theory, methodology, and computational tools to enable
      large-scale and multidimensional networks. By bringing together leading
      social network researchers and leading developers of cyberinfrastructure
      in diverse science and engineering communities, the Workshop will also
      promote: (i) the specification of new mathematical and statistical models
      with broad application in the social and behavioral sciences, (ii) the
      development and extension of scalable algorithms to analyze and visualize
      the large scale and multidimensional networks that exist within these
      cybercommunities, and (iii) the development and extension of advanced
      user-driven software and web services that implement these algorithms to
      help members of a cybercommunity leverage their communication and
      knowledge networks. <br/>Broader impacts: The Workshop will offer a unique
      means for a symbiotic exchange of insights between the social network
      analysis research community (which cuts across many disciplines, but
      especially sociology, psychology, communication, organizational science,
      information science and economic) and the key developers of
      cyberinfrastructure (which cuts across many disciplines including
      atmospheric sciences, geo sciences, environmental engineering, ecological
      research, and public health). The Workshop will help network scholars and
      students identify the challenges as well as the opportunities of social
      networking to enable research and education within a cyberinfrastructure.
      This will result in a direct transfer of knowledge and results from the
      fields of specialist social network research to wider scientific
      communities exploring the development of cyberinfrastructure in their
      fields. The workshop will also assess the viability and contours of
      developing a Social Network Analysis Cyberinfrastructure for advancing
      network analysis, modeling, visualization research and education. The
      broad mix of researchers from these various communities has the potential
      to unleash a new generation of theory, education, and practice on the role
      of social networking and 21st century cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>"

      become the number one killer of adults under the age of 85 in the United
      States today. At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is
      eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are
      acute, system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric

      substantial empirical evidence, distributed across its network of tobacco
      researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar/low-nicotine brands)
      cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers
      began to understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and
      information across the entire community. In response, government agencies
      involved in public health have made a substantial foundational investment
      in developing a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems
      integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the Tobacco
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN). While such an
      underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in discoveries
      (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above)

      that truly addresses the needs of today's science policy makers given the
      constraints of existing datasets as well as theoretical and algorithmic
      approaches can proceed. <br/>This study addresses three challenges. First,
      a detailed analysis is conducted of the information needs of a
      representative set of science policy makers including existing data,
      approaches and tools. Second, a theoretic conceptualization is developed
      of tasks relevant to science policymaking that maps the needs of policy
      makers to theoretically grounded and practically valuable processing
      pipelines that transform data into actionable information. This
      conceptualization is then made available online in a wiki-like format for
      community review and consensus building. Third, a prototypical tool--a
      macroscope--is designed to visualize structure, patterns, trends, and
      outliers in science and technology data sets that are too large and
      complex to be comprehensible to the researchers through direct
      observation--just like microscopes and telescopes make it possible to see
      things that are too small or too far away. The prototypical macroscope
      supports a well defined set of information needs, e.g., identification of
      emerging research frontiers or correlation of funding with publications
      and patents in an area of research and exploration of results using graphs
      and geospatial and science maps. Macroscope tool development will benefit
      from the NSF funded Scholarly Database (SDB)) that provides access to more
      than 20 million scholarly records, and the Cyberinfrastructure Shell
      (CIShell), which supports the easy plug and play of datasets and
      algorithms and the design of stand-alone tools. Usability studies are
      conducted to evaluate and optimize the macroscope. The macroscope as well
      as its support of advanced science mapping techniques will be introduced
      to a broader audience by means of the Places and Spaces: Mapping Science
      exhibit. Researchers and science policymakers in Japan will participate in
      this project, generating a bi-directional flow of best theory and
      practice.<br/>The scientific study and management of science and
      technology requires a shared terminology and conceptualization of how
      science works. It requires shared data repositories that can be used to
      run benchmarks and comparisons of algorithms, to thoroughly validate the
      combination of algorithms, indicators, and evaluation procedures. The
      theoretical component of this study, as well as the extension of the SDB
      and the prototypical design of a macroscope, will create a basic shared
      understanding and a freely available cyberinfrastructure and tool for the
      science of science (policy) community. <br/>The same capabilities that
      could make the macroscope a tool of choice for science policy makers could
      also make it attractive to other potential users. For instance, students
      or members of the public will be able to see the large scale structures of
      science, and find potential areas of interest for further study;
      researchers will be able to monitor and access research results, relevant
      funding opportunities, or find potential collaborators within and without
      their fields of inquiry. Program managers and reviewers will use it to
      meet their individual needs."

      will be able to perform network analysis with the most effective
      algorithms available. In addition, they will be able to generate, run, and
      validate network models to advance their understanding of the structure
      and dynamics of particular networks. NWB will provide advanced
      visualization tools to interactively explore and understand specific
      networks, as well as their interaction with other types of networks.
      <br/><br/>A major computer science challenge is the development of an
      algorithm integration framework that supports the easy integration and
      dissemination of existing and new algorithms and can deal with the
      multitude of network data formats in existence today. Another challenge is
      the design and implementation of an easy to use menu-based, online portal
      interface for interactive algorithm selection, data manipulation, user and
      session management. The NWB will be evaluated in diverse research projects
      and educational settings in biology, social and behavioral science, and
      physics research. It will be well documented and available as open source
      for easy duplication and usage at other sites. An annual summer school and
      a series of workshops and tutorials are planned to introduce the tool to
      diverse research communities. <br/><br/>The NWB will provide members of
      the scientific research community at large (biologists, physicists,
      computer scientists, social and behavioral scientists, engineers, etc.)
      with the means to carry out network analysis, modeling, and visualization
      projects in their own fields. This will result in a direct transfer of
      knowledge and results from the fields of specialist network research to a
      wider scientific community. Researchers will have access to validated
      algorithms that in the past have been obtained through time-consuming
      personal developments of ad hoc computer programs. The NWB is expected to
      enhance and encourage the empirical analysis and model validation of
      networks, generating an eventual acceleration in the development of
      network science research. Online instructional material will support the
      use of the NWB in educational settings. <br/><br/>The NWB will provide a
      unique tool for network science researchers in many disciplines. In
      effect, NWB can deploy the knowledge accumulated in network theory and
      practice across sciences with just one web click to any interested
      researcher, practitioner, or student. The NWB shared resources environment
      will speed up and ease network science applications and education in
      biology, social and behavioral science, and large infrastructure analysis,

      Indiana University<br/><br/>A new field of Sustainability Science and
      Engineering is emerging that seeks to understand the fundamental character
      of interactions between nature and human society and to help steer the
      impact of humanity's needs on the planet's natural resources towards
      sustainable trajectories. Sustainability Science and Engineering is
      unified in clear terms by its ultimate goals but occupies an
      interdisciplinary position among traditional research fields, spanning
      both science and engineering and spreading across disciplines as diverse
      as agriculture, ecology, oceanography, climate studies, economics, a
      diverse set of social sciences, energy and materials and several
      additional aspects of engineering, physics, biology, and chemistry.
      Although Sustainability Science and engineering is by now widely discussed
      in the scientific and engineering community, and is beginning to be
      connected to the political agenda for economic and social development, it
      remains unclear to what extent its many facets are being integrated into a
      global perspective and whether researchers are utilizing it as a nexus to
      collaborate across traditional scientific and engineering fields. This
      project will address such issues by delineating, analyzing, and mapping
      both basic research on sustainability. Specifically, a comprehensive
      dataset of scholarly publications, patents, research grants, policy
      documents and popular science pieces that together define the integrated
      knowledge of the field will be compiled. <br/><br/>Analysis results will
      be presented as tables, graphs, and in form of geospatial and science
      maps. Sustainability experts will be invited to interpret these results.
      Findings will be presented, discussed, and disseminated via scholarly
      publications, online, and at a workshop on the topic of sustainability.
      Encouraging timely scientific and engineering progress across a large set
      of traditional disciplines requires generating a global perspective (a
      view 'from above') to determine the most effective actions and incentives
      to be created by governments, funding agencies, non-governmental
      organizations, the scientific community, and the public at large. This
      work will map the current state of sustainability science and engineering
      worldwide and provide actionable insights into its future development. The
      resulting maps will be useful for communicating the state of the art as
      well as to point out challenges and opportunities. They might be extended
      and adopted as a visual interface into research and practice of
      Sustainability Science and Engineering. Several graduate students will be
      involved and trained in this project."
