The Center will enhance the development of applications of computational methods in biology, the use of artificial intelligence in computer science, and the enhancement of genetic algorithms in engineering design. Evolution by natural selection defines an algorithmic approach to finding solutions for complex problems; computer scientists and engineers have harnessed similar algorithms to a diversity of challenges that require optimization over multiple competing dimensions. Likewise, biologists have begun to employ digital modeling of the evolutionary process to examine evolution of complex biological structures and patterns in areas such as paleontology and the gene networks, which defy experimental manipulation in vivo. The Center will promote these interdisciplinary efforts by coordinating activities through three thrust groups: (1) Evolution of Genomes, Networks, and Evolvability, (2) Evolution of Behavior and Intelligence, and (3) Evolution of Communities and Collective Dynamics. <br/><br/>This center has the potential to transform both biology and computational sciences by developing digital experiments to test and apply fundamental principles of evolutionary biology. The possible impacts will be far reaching: from cyber-security to everyday computing applications, from the evolution of disease resistance to the self-organization of social behavior. The BEACON center will train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and educate the public about evolution and its role in solving real-world problems through significant educational outreach for K12 students and science museums."

The Center for Research in Cognitive Science unites a diverse and               richly interconnected group from many traditional disciplines                   (computer science, linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and                    psychology).  The goal of the research is to understand the                     processes and mechanisms by which human beings acquire knowledge                about their environment, store and retrieve that knowledge,                     communicate it to others, and apply it to carry out actions and                 manipulate their environment.                                                                                                                                   The research is organized into three separate but highly                        interrelated themes:  perception and action, language learning,                 and language processing.  Research in the area of perception and                action spans the processes involved in the first stages of visual               and auditory representation of spatial and spectral information,                to higher order representations of more complex attributes, to                  the storage and retrieval of such representations by the organism               as they are used in goal-oriented actions.  The study of language               learning focuses on how children develop the abstract                           representations of language on the basis of their visual and                    auditory perceptions.  The research in language processing                      combines investigation of formal systems with investigation of                  computational models, all in the context of empirical study of a                wide range of natural languages.                                                                                                                                Significant features of the perception and action research are                  its increasing fidelity to actual neural computation and its                    sophisticated computational modeling and related potential for                  contributing to artificial intelligence technology.  The language               learning research has significant potential for technological                   spin-off in machine learning and automatic acquisition of lexical               and grammatical information for language systems, crucial to the                development of grammars sufficient for the robust analysis of                   unconstrained text.  And the language processing research will                  have significant impact on the technological base for human-                    computer interaction, in particular the design of natural                       language interfaces for data base and expert systems and                        knowledge-rich systems in general.

SILC's purpose is to develop the new science of spatial learning and to use this knowledge to transform STEM educational practice. Spatial learning is the acquisition of spatial knowledge and skills, and the use of spatial knowledge and skills to facilitate learning in both spatial and non-spatial domains. It provides the foundation for a wide range of reasoning skills in STEM-based activities, from solving mathematical problems to engineering new products to understanding graphical depictions of complex systems. Previous research shows that spatial skills are a strong predictor of entry into STEM disciplines in college and into STEM careers, that substantial improvement of spatial learning is possible, and that this improvement matters to STEM success. SILC has brought together researchers from multiple lines of work on spatial cognition and education and from a variety of traditional disciplines (e. g., cognitive science, psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, education, STEM disciplines), integrating them to achieve new insights. SILC researchers are developing a set of powerful tools for spatial learning, honing them into effective, deployable educational techniques and practices for STEM learning, including advanced technology (e.g., intelligent educational software), effective curriculum units (e.g., in elementary school mathematics), engaging activities (e.g., in children's museums), and spatial assessment instruments (e.g., testing children's spatial skills, testing adults' STEM-relevant spatial skills). Several of the insights, tools and products from SILC's initial funding period already hold transformational potential for spatial learning. Research and translational activities in the second and last funding period, from 2011-2016, will continue the investment in the science of spatial learning, in order to allow the fulfillment of this promise."

HUBO will be the first homogeneous, full-sized humanoid to be used as a common research and education platform. Eight universities (Drexel, CMU, MIT, Ohio State, Penn, Purdue, Southern California, and VaTech), representing a critical mass of humanoids research within US, participate in this development of the world's first homogeneous full-sized humanoid team. Building upon unique expertise, the work extends current capabilities, resulting in six identical units, facilitating the following potentially transformative advances in robotics:<br/>- A state-of-the-art, standardized humanoid platform instrument with embedded capabilities for sensing, manipulation, and rapid locomotion, ideal for a broad range of future humanoids research<br/>- The ability, for the first time, to directly compare and across validate algorithms and methodologies and consistently benchmark results across research teams<br/>- Novel energy storage technology for mobile robotics incorporating supercapacitors for operations requiring high power density, far exceeding the capabilities of traditional battery-only power sources<br/>- A widely distributed platform that motivates, recruits, and trains a broad range of students spanning multiple disciplines, including artificial intelligence, digital, signal processing, mechanics, and control<br/>Humanoids, robots engineered to mimic human form and motion, open broad avenues of cross disciplinary research spanning multiple fields, such as mechanical control, artificial intelligence, and power systems. Common humanoids are rarely autonomous and are not-ready for unconstrained interaction with humans. The most compelling demonstrations are meticulously pre-programmed and painstakingly choreographed. A few common platforms have already advanced some research. Hence, having a consistent platform should facilitate rapid progress in areas needed for autonomy and natural interaction, including mobility, manipulation, robot vision, speech communication, and cognition and learning. However, although currently Japan and Korea are considered world leaders in design and construction of humanoids, best practices have not been developed for constructing multiple, identical humanoids. These conditions call for the making of an urgently needed benchmark providing evaluations and cross-validation of results. With this development and the servicing of 6 humanoids, this project aims to create knowledge and best practices contributing to robotics research, possibly leading to the standardization needed for ubiquity.<br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The instrument enables US researchers to develop expertise in the design and construction of humanoids, while the distribution of the work activities ensures the broad dissemination of the knowledge. Humanoids research, inherently interdisciplinary and integrative, inspires young students. The graduate and undergraduates students participating are likely to receive a world-class training in robotics. Outreach partners, including several high-profile museums will introduce people of all ages to the exciting technologies of robotics, particularly useful in recruiting K-12 students into science, engineering, mathematics, etc. A partnership with the Science Leadership Academy (SLA), a magnet school with more than 63% underrepresented students, assures their involvement. With SLA, the project initiates an annual program modeled on a NASA-style experiment design competition, in which students use simulation tools to propose humanoids projects and activities. Selected winner(s) will have their proposed projects implemented on HUBO."

The COPLINK Center for Excellence aims to achieve the following two goals:  1) Develop knowledge management systems technologies and methodology that are appropriate for capturing, analyzing, visualizing and sharing law enforcement related information in social and organizational contexts.  The basis of such research will be grounded in information retrieval, computational linguistics, information visualization, artificial intelligence, multimedia systems, multi-agent systems, and telecommunications.  2) Study of organizational, social, cultural and methodological impacts and changes that organizations need to make to maximize and leverage on a law enforcement agency's investments in information and knowledge management.  The academic foundation for such research will be based on social informatics, decision theory, communication theory, cognitive psychology and managerial and organizational research.<br/>"

With this technology, students' models 'come alive' as interactive multimedia artifacts that combine animation, sound, and narration. The curricular focus is on physical and earth sciences, and the technology supports multimodal interactive scientific modeling for four curricular units: forces and motion, magnetism and electricity, landforms, and weather and climate.  A central feature of this environment is PadMates, which are intelligent virtual tutors that support science learning through interactive scientific modeling.<br/><br/>The PIs investigate the cognitive mechanisms by which learning occurs.  Specifically, they study the central issues of problem solving (strategy use, divergent thinking, and collaboration) and engagement (motivation, situational interest, presence) with respect to achievement as measured by both science content knowledge and transfer. With diverse student populations in 60 classrooms drawn from both urban and rural settings, the studies determine precisely which technologies and conditions contribute most effectively to learning processes and outcomes.<br/><br/>The products include technologies and findings that should be the basis of a framework to inform the future development of similar systems.

The Multimodal Integrated Neural Technologies (MINT) hub aims to develop and provide tools that are able to read from and modulate neurons at multiple sites independently at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The hub will disseminate tools and methods to correlate the recorded cell activity with the structural connection. In this way, the connectivity of active cells can be visualized, labeled, and traced for detailed functional mapping. The mission of the MINT hub is to provide a collection of tools, synergistically developed, integrated, and available to the neuroscience community, to address one theme: connecting neurophysiology and structural analysis with a greater scale and resolution. The synergistic integration of these neurotechnology tools at the MINT Hub would accelerate the rate of discovery in neuroscience. This in turn can be expected to pave the way to improved treatments for neurological disorders and to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, especially neuromorphic computing. The MINT hub will provide annual training workshops for new users to be familiar with new technologies and able to use them effectively. To achieve sustainability, the hardware tools will be actively marketed to the community and those with sustainable volume will be transitioned to commercialization partners. Importantly, this program will cross-train neuroscience and technology personnel during the course of this program, resulting in preparation of a new generation of multi-disciplinary engineers and scientists.<br/><br/>This hub uniquely combines high-density electrodes, chemical sensing, optical stimulation, and cell labeling. Fiberless high-density optoelectrodes can allow optical stimulation of individual or few neurons with high specificity and selectivity using monolithically integrated micro-LEDs or optical waveguides on multi-shank silicon probes. Carbon microthreads will be used to create advanced arrays that will dramatically increase the ability to record from interconnected neurons and label those cells with high accuracy. Advanced metal alloys will also be used to greatly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of miniaturized electrodes. The MINT hub will innovate viral vector delivery and tissue clearing in the nervous system and combine these with multispectral labeling for intact cell phenotyping. Furthermore, an open-source software will be developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of anatomical reconstruction for creating connectivity maps. The MINT hub will validate the developed tools and methods in three in-vivo experiments to exemplify what can be accomplished when the proposed modalities and methods are synergistically integrated.

There is growing recognition that privacy and security failures are often the results of cognitive and behavioral biases and human errors. Many of these failures can be attributed to poorly designed user interfaces or secure systems that have not been built around the needs and skills of their human operators; in other words, systems that have not made privacy and security usable. This IGERT will train cross-disciplinary researchers and develop methodologies, principles, and approaches that can be applied to diverse systems and applications. With social and economic activities becoming increasingly reliant on cyber infrastructure and with 60% of security breaches attributable to human failure, this IGERT addresses one of the most fundamental challenges faced by society today: designing usable secure systems. It does so by: (1) producing research advances that will provide for usable privacy and security in both current and future pervasive computing environments; (2) training a new generation of researchers to engage in interdisciplinary research on usable privacy and security and apply such research to real-world problems; (3) recruiting and training students underrepresented in traditional computer security and information assurance graduate programs.

In this project the PI and her interdisciplinary team of investigators will design computer vision algorithms for intelligent tracking of large groups of living individuals in three-dimensional space.  She will develop specific systems for tracking groups of microorganisms, bats, birds, and humans.  And she will formulate machine learning methods for analyzing group behavior, specifically the conditions for formation and dispersal of groups, and the interactions of individuals within a group.  An important innovative aspect of this research is the systematic and comprehensive approach to reasoning about the motion of large groups of living organisms observed in video data, independently of whether they happen to be humans, animals, or cells.  Previous efforts in this area have typically focused on studying the behavior of a single type of organism, and on testing theories of behavior based predominately on simulations, without the appropriate analytical tools to automatically explore and quantify the vast number of visual data sets.  This project, on the other hand, will base research findings on the analysis of thousands of trajectories of individual group members moving in 3D space.  To this end, the PI and her team will collect video data in the field and in public spaces to ensure optimal data capture conditions.  They will use these data to develop robust solutions for the problem of matching hundreds of individual bats, birds, or people from frame to frame.  They will generate stereoscopic reconstructions of movement trajectories based on multiple calibrated cameras, and use machine learning to model group behavior and mine the trajectory data.  Finally, they will compare the findings of their reasoning system against current theories about the formation of groups and the interactions of individuals within a group.  A similar, systematic research strategy will be employed to address understanding of the behavior of single cells.  The team will design microscope imaging protocols, develop solutions for the segmentation and tracking of individual cells, and use statistical learning techniques to discover patterns and correlations in the behavior of the cells on physiologically relevant substrates.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Understanding the processes by which groups of animals and microorganisms behave is crucial to the effective conservation of populations and ecosystems and the management of cellular environments.  Project outcomes will advance knowledge across the fields of computer vision, artificial intelligence, behavioral ecology, and biological engineering, and will provide new tools for answering urgent economic and ethical questions, for example about the mortality of birds and bats in wind energy facilities."

While focused on a delineated population, this project will have a broader impact by refining the STEM curricula through the addition of review and practice sessions, laboratory upgrades, and the addition of a mathematics lab for teaching and research along with the infusion of technology, cooperative learning, and writing in the STEM disciplines.  These interventions will improve the science research, teaching and learning environment, not only for STEM majors but also for all University students who take STEM courses as major or general education requirements.  Unique to the STEM Academy is outreach to regional high school students.  The transition from high school to college will be specifically addressed by STEM Academy programs to ensure that students are integrated into the University community prior to starting their first year thus ensuring that these important and often under-served students are not lost but are provided every opportunity to gain entry into STEM careers.  The successful participation of undergraduate, and even high school students, in the STEM Academy will help to reduce the national under-representation of minorities, especially African Americans, in STEM careers."

The Honda ASIMO and KAIST HUBO are adult-sized humanoids that have captured public interest and have given researchers insight on issues ranging from balance disorders to cognition and perception.  This 5-year PIRE project teams U.S. and Korean universities (Drexel University, University of Pennsylvania, Virginia Tech, Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr Women's College, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Seoul National University and Korea University) to advance humanoids.<br/><br/>The critical technical gap that prevents a vertical advance in robotics is the lack of universally available platforms to reproduce results and validate hypotheses.  This PIRE's goal is to provide humanoid platforms to a wide audience of researchers by developing a 3-tier tool set based on KAIST's HUBO humanoid: (1) virtual-HUBO is a free and open emulator for testing AI and IT concepts; (2) mini-HUBO is a low-cost 20-inch tall version of the full-sized humanoid for implementing algorithms; and (3) online-HUBO is a tethered version of the full-size humanoid that is accessible for researchers over the internet.  This 3-tier approach provides little to no barriers to entry to humanoid research.  These platforms will provide U.S. scientists and engineers the opportunity to leverage U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) and information technology (IT) to advance humanoid abilities in perception, cognition and social interaction.<br/><br/>To reach the next generation of robotic scientist and engineers, the PIRE team is working closely with the Philadelphia Please Touch Museum (PTM) to design exhibits featuring HUBO to inspire and motivate students to pursue science and engineering careers.<br/><br/>This PIRE project engages each member's unique resources, including electro-mechanical design (Korean collaborators), virtual-HUBO (Bryn Mawr), online-HUBO and co-op program (Drexel), mini-HUBO (Virginia Tech), advanced locomotion (UPenn) and human-robot interaction (Swarthmore).  The 6-month co-op cycles (twice per year) at KAIST provide 20 U.S. undergraduates with an international research experience to cultivate skills and appreciation for effective global teaming and research.   Shorter but more frequent visits by graduate students and faculty serve similarly functions but also ensure research goals and objectives are met.  Lastly, Drexel's School of Education and Senior Personnel assess student performance, global teaming, and engineering skill acquisition.  <br/><br/>This PIRE is supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the Robust Intelligence (RI) Cluster of the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) found within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/>"

Interdisciplinary research is a perfect setting for vertical integration and<br/>the Duke Mathematics Department has existing disciplinary strengths in algebraic geometry, analysis, differential equations, differential geometry, numerical analysis, probability, and topology.<br/><br/>We will use the team research model to enhance our graduate training program and our undergraduate and postdoctoral programs.  Graduate and undergraduate students will confront <br/>research problems early in their careers and will have ongoing exposure to them through their respective programs.  Advanced graduate students and postdocs will take on new roles as project leaders in vertically integrated research seminar courses and in team research groups.<br/>All students and postdocs will develop skills in computation, communication and collaboration as part of their mathematical training, thereby broadening the range of opportunities available<br/>to them as mathematical scientists.  The goal of the program is to have students and postdocs completing their programs with a broad scientific knowledge and clear understanding of the inner workings of a scientific team, as well as an academic research and teaching portfolio that will enhance their career advancement potential.<br/><br/>In the undergraduate program our goal is to increase students' enthusiasm for mathematics and its role in research at all levels of their training at Duke.  We will increase the number of first-year and major seminars aimed at exposing students to current topics of research.  Current seminar course topics include cryptography, physiology and medicine, geometry, and optimization.  New topics include heart dynamics, gravitational lensing, and artificial intelligence. A new Perspectives on Science seminar aimed at first-year women interested in mathematics, statistics and computer science will expose young students to current research of senior scientists, postdocs, and graduate students.<br/><br/>The cornerstone of the undergraduate VIGRE program is a new two-year intensive research program, entitled `Practical Research for Undergraduates with VIGRE' (PRUV, pronounced ""prove""), for advanced mathematics majors, which integrates course work, summer internships in a vertically integrated environment, and senior theses.  These improvements in the undergraduate program are targeted to involve more students in research activities.  We expect<br/>that one outcome will be more senior honors theses on research problems and more students choosing to apply to graduate school in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>For the graduate program, the VIGRE grant will be combined with Duke resources to support all first year students without teaching duties.  After the first year, the strongest VIGRE-eligible students will receive a one semester-per-year teaching release in order to direct more of their energy towards research.  All graduate students in the graduate program will have the opportunity to work in vertically integrated research teams, including postdocs, graduate students PRUV students, and at least one mathematics professor.  Those working on interdisciplinary problems <br/>will also collaborate with at least one professor from another discipline.  Current interdisciplinary activities include deforestation and aerosol dynamics, geometric computing, granular flow,<br/> heart dynamics, liquid films, photonic band gaps,  physiology and medicine,<br/> string theory, and uncertainty in porous flow, with Duke collaborators in the School of the Environment, Computer Science, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Cell Biology, Civil and Environmental Engineering, and the Institute for Statistics and Decision Sciences. <br/><br/>Graduate teacher training currently begins in the first-year with students supervising<br/>calculus laboratories.  In order to shorten time to degree and increase retention, we will postpone teaching responsibilities and teacher training by one year for all graduate students.<br/>This will enable all first year graduate students to focus on fundamental course work required to pass the qualifying exam before the beginning of year two. The current teacher-training program will be expanded to include alternative teaching experiences for students and postdocs<br/>including outreach to high school teachers, and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students. A new computational requirement will be part of their first-year curriculum. The graduate students currently run a weekly seminar with talks aimed at first and second year graduate students given by graduate students and postdocs. PRUV undergraduates will be encouraged to attend this seminar.<br/><br/>VIGRE postdocs will play a leadership role in the overall program. Each year, for the first three years, two VIGRE postdocs will be hired for three year terms.  These positions will parallel existing Duke funded Assistant Research Professors (ARP).  VIGRE Postdocs will have the opportunity to play a strong leadership role in the team research groups including mentoring graduate students and undergraduates and developing a well-defined independent research program.  They will also have the opportunity to take on a significant supporting role in at least one of the following activities:  (1) coordinating research seminars and workshops, (2) co-supervising summer PRUV students and graduate student internships, (3) helping undergraduates and graduate students in a writing workshop.<br/><br/>Postdocs and students will collaborate with high school teachers in Project CHISEL `Carolina High School Educational Leadership project'.  They will design modules for classroom use<br/>that will introduce high school students to the use of mathematics in current research.<br/><br/>Funding for this activity was provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office for Multidisciplinary Activity.<br/><br/>"

Through the use of advanced artificial intelligence and intelligent tutoring techniques, Virtual Humans will provide a highly responsive functionality in their dialogue interpretation that will generate sophisticated interaction with visitors about the STEM content related to the exhibit. The project exemplifies how the confluence of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and education can creatively and collaboratively advance new tools and learning processes. The Virtual Human project will begin to present to the visitor a compelling, real life, interactive example of the future and of the related convergence of various interdisciplinary trends in technology, such as natural language voice recognition, mixed reality environments, para-holographic display, visitor recognition and prior activity recall, artificial intelligence, and other interdisciplinary trends. The 3-D, life-sized Virtual Humans will serve as museum educators in four capacities: 1) as a natural language dialogue-based interactive guide that can suggest exhibits to explore in specific galleries and answer questions about particular STEM content areas, such as computer science; 2) as a coach to help visitors understand and use particular interactive exhibits; 3) be the core focus of the Science behind the Virtual Humans exhibit; and 4) serve as an ongoing research effort to improve human and virtual human interactions at increasingly sophisticated levels of complexity. The deliverables will be designed to build upon visitor experiences and stimulate inquiry. A living lab enables visitors to become part of the research and development process. The project website will introduce visitors to the technologies used to build virtual humans and the research behind their implementation. The site will be augmented with videos and simulations and will generate user created content on virtual human characters. Project evaluation and research will collect language and behavioral data from visitors to inform the improvement of the virtual guide throughout the duration of the grant and to develop a database that directly supports other intelligent systems, and new interface design and development that will have broad impact across multiple fields.<br/><br/>"

Research on distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) and multi-layered, intelligent, and adaptive multiagent systems (MAS) will be carried out to develop a new framework for real-time supervision of distributed system operations. The stability, scalability, performance, and robustness of this framework will be explored, and test cases will be used to investigate the synergy between microreactor and computer networks to discover ways of enhancing their stability and productivity. Manufacturing process and computer network operations will be the application domains of this monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, and control with agent-based system (MADCABS) that automates knowledge extraction from data, analysis, and decision-making. The research will also focus on investigating emergence of behavior patterns in both the physical systems and MADCABS, introducing evolutionary dynamics in analysis, diagnosis and control by rewarding successful strategies over time, and enhancing the stability and robustness of MADCABS by designing it with adaptation capabilities.<br/>Multiple layers of agents will be used, where lower-level agents are performing local well-defined tasks such as data validation and higher-level agents performing more global tasks over wider regions of the supervised system. Agents are capable of acting, communicating with other agents, perceiving their environment, and determining behavior to satisfy their objectives. However, agents have only partial information about their environments and may initiate actions that could conflict with actions of other agents, leading to emergence of undesirable behavior of the supervised system. In this sense, the supervised system is viewed as a self-organized complex system comprised of the operating units of the process and layers of MADCABS agents acting upon them. Complex adaptive systems (CAS) studied often by using artificial life (AL) paradigms. CAS are known to exhibit emergence phenomena in which the global system displays properties and features not inherent to any of its components. Analysis and examination of the long-term behavior of the MADCABS supervised systems will be used to assess the compatibility levels of sets of agent characteristics and their optimal task orientation. <br/>The project is led by an interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in DAI, MAS, CAS, supervision of computer network and manufacturing process operations, and real-time KBS development. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is combining new modeling theories and software for studying CAS. Collaboration between IIT and ANL will provide a strong partnership with powerful resources to carry out the proposed research, education, and outreach activities. Research results will contribute to advancement of knowledge in CAS, MAS, DAI, and AL. The outcome of the research will provide a new approach for commercial software for supervision of process and computer network operations. Research on behavior and controllability of distributed microreactor networks will result in new approaches to analyze the viability of such systems and ability to manufacture high-value-added specialty chemicals. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The research results will be used to promote education and training activities in DAI, AL, and complex adaptive system operation and supervision. The methods and tools developed will have an impact on many CAS central to national concerns, such as energy distribution systems, ecosystems, and epidemics. Consequently, research results will be disseminated in the form of software, case studies, and practical training to university and industry researchers, high school teachers, students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, and undergraduate students."

The PIs conduct two cycles of experiments to examine how tablets affect students learning in 4th and 5th grade mathematics and science.  The project research questions and methods focus on systematic monitoring of teachers' and students' responses to the innovation in order to inform the development process. The PIs collect data on teachers' and students' use of the technology and on student learning outcomes and use those data as empirical evidence about the promise of the technology for improving STEM education in K-12 schools.  An external evaluator uses parallel data collection, conducting many of the same research activities as the core team and independently providing analysis to be correlated with other data.  His involvement is continuous and provides formative evaluation reports to the project through conferences, site visits, and conference calls.  <br/><br/>The primary products are substantiated research findings on the use of tablet computers, inscriptions, and networks in 4th and 5 grade classrooms.  In addition the PIs develop models for teacher education and use, and demonstrate the utility of artificial intelligence techniques in facilitating use of the technology.  With the addition of Malden Public Schools to the list of participating districts, which includes Cambridge Public Schools and Waltham Public Schools from earlier work, the project expands the field test sites to up 20 schools' classrooms."

How do you incent people to contribute personal information and recommendations in recommender systems and discretionary databases? While this project is motivated by its potential application to electronic commerce, the focus is on foundational matters. Computing in the Internet era means computing in the context of multiple  self-interested entities, which in turn means that reasoning about computing must take the incentives of these entities into account. This, in turn, calls for a fundamental integration of ideas from computer science (such as fault tolerance, fairness, verification, algorithms, complexity, graphical models of uncertainty, machine learning) with elements of game theory (such as mechanism design, equilibrium analysis, game representations, learning, and agency theory). The outcome is expected to benefit electronic commerce, but also more fundamentally to help lay the foundations for a new area of research called ""non-cooperative computing."""

By exploiting reductionist theories of musical structure and performance (i.e., musical style), this project will develop hierarchical, stochastic music representations and concomitant storage and retrieval mechanisms that are well-suited to music's unique characteristics, and are both musically and psycho-acoustically plausible. A software system exploiting these representations and retrieval mechanisms will be developed that accepts sonic input, compares abstractions of this input to those in a database of digital recordings, returns sonic samples of the database that best match the query, and allows the user to refine the query using music/acoustic-based interfaces of varying degrees of complexity. This research will yield a working music-search engine will application to e-commerce and will provide new scientific knowledge in terms of algorithms and mathematic models in the fields of databases, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, signal processing and perception, for music search and retrieval, which will generalize to other multimedia processing tasks.<br/><br/>"

Numbering approximately 20,000 species, ants dominate many terrestrial environments and in some habitats they constitute 15 to 20% of the total weight of all animals combined.  Perhaps the major factor contributing to the ubiquity and importance of ants is their complex, cooperative societies.  Ants are involved in intimate biological interactions with countless other organisms, and exhibit many remarkable behaviors, including agriculture of fungi, harvesting of seeds, herding and ""milking"" of other insects, cooperative hunting in packs, slave-making, and communal nest weaving.  The parallels between these behaviors in ants and those found in humans have inspired public and scientific curiosity alike.  Human understanding of ants suffers, unfortunately, from a lack of scientific research on ant history and genetics.  This research project will remedy this problem by reconstructing the history of ants, from the Age of Dinosaurs to the present, using evidence both from ant anatomy and ant DNA.  Techniques unavailable to previous generations of ant researchers, such as PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of genes, will be used to gather molecular data.  Some of these data will come from newly discovered genes, which will also yield broad insights about the genetics of other animals.  These data will be analyzed using state-of-the-art computing algorithms and hardware in order to reconstruct the ""family tree"" of all major lineages of ants.  Dates for major events in the history of ants will be inferred by combining fossil evidence with molecular dating techniques.  These results will be integrated with the large body of pre-existing data on ant ecology and behavior, in order to cast new light on ant biology and to suggest new pathways for future investigation.<br/><br/>This project will have a substantial impact on both science and society.  This work will involve university and museum faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, and technical staff who will interact during all stages of the project with an international team of scientific collaborators.   <br/>The study of ant biology occupies a central role in a diverse number of disciplines including ecology, conservation biology, molecular biology and genetics, chemical communication, biodiversity studies, and artificial intelligence research.  As just one example, ant diversity has become a leading indicator of habitat quality in conservation biology, so a better understanding of the history and genetics of ants will increase our ability to make informed conservation decisions.  The information generated by this project will be disseminated through scientific publications, as well as through a book geared towards a more general audience.  The scientific results from this project also will be presented in user-friendly internet interfaces on the World-Wide Web, which will be made available to all interested members of the scientific community and the general public.<br/>"

Seminal studies have shown that tutoring is significantly more effective than group instruction and may provide unparalleled opportunities for learning.  A central, unanswered research question is, ""How do expert tutors provide effective cognitive and motivational support over the course of long-term tutorial interactions to improve learning?"" With a curricular focus of college-level computer science education, this project will see the design and evaluation of a computer-based intelligent tutoring system, JavaTutor, which leverages artificial intelligence to provide both cognitive and motivational support.  The project will be conducted at North Carolina State University in conjunction with three partner institutions: Meredith College, Shaw University, and St.  Augustine's College.  <br/><br/>The project has three major thrusts.  First, the research team will conduct a semester-long observational study of cognitive and affective tutorial support provided by expert human tutors interacting with students in a fully-instrumented online tutoring environment.  The environment will log all tutorial conversations, problem-solving traces, and affective data streams including physiological signals, posture, and facial expressions.  Second, the research team will develop an empirically grounded, integrated model of cognitive and affective scaffolding using machine learning techniques including hidden Markov modeling.  Third, they will validate the integrated model of cognitive and affective scaffolding in a semester-long experiment with the JavaTutor intelligent tutoring system.  Four versions of the JavaTutor system will be deployed and compared.  It is hypothesized that over the course of a semester, the version with an integrated model of cognitive and motivational scaffolding will outperform each of the other models on both cognitive and affective student outcomes and yield differential effects across learner groups, accruing particularly significant benefit to low-performing and female students.<br/><br/>The products of this project include findings and technologies that will inform the future development of intelligent tutoring systems.  By promoting rich learning interactions through integrated cognitive and motivational scaffolding, the project will create new learning environment technologies that promote high levels of achievement and find broad application in STEM education.  It is anticipated that the resulting intelligent tutoring system technologies will serve as a foundation for the next generation of educational software that both complements and expands the impact of classroom teachers.  The impact should be significant given the effectiveness of human tutoring and the potential power of these new technologies to support learning."

These distinct steps drive up the cost barrier to introduction of new and improved materials into the industrial pipeline and increase the cost of domestically manufactured advanced nanomaterials. Fortunately, recent developments in numerical modeling, additive manufacturing, and rapid testing of materials suggest that a new approach to material development and nanomanufacturing, where the previously distinct and time-consuming phases could be carried out nearly instantaneously to arrive at optimal material structure as well as process conditions for its manufacture. The focus of this award is to revamp the traditional, open-loop synthesis of nanostructured materials by: 1) using a versatile 3-D printing approach to manufacture these nanomaterials and nanostructures, 2) incorporate material property characterization directly into the printing process, and 3) use an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to adjust on the fly process conditions to achieve desired material properties. These concepts and components will be integrated into technical coursework, hands-on research opportunities, and outreach workshops to a broad range of students and the public. The co-PIs plan to leverage existing outreach and educational activities through their group's collaboration with a local museum, as well as curricular and extracurricular activities.<br/> <br/>The approach and framework is an investigation of process modeling, materials synthesis and characterization, and system design to autonomously discover new material configurations and reduce manufacturing defects and uncertainty. This AI framework will ""understand"" process-structure-property relationships, manufacturing constraints, and, importantly, statistical variations in material properties and manufacturing quality. The intellectual merit of this study is the discovery of general nanomanufacturing tools and feedstocks, with supervisory genetic algorithms, that autonomously correct for defects and compensate for innate manufacturing inaccuracies by a search for alternative designs; this is in contrast to standard tools that minimize uncertainty (e.g. environmental controls) or rely on post-fabrication characterization with human intervention. The framework will be tested using nanoscale additive manufacturing (AM) as the fundamental manufacturing tool and nanostructured metamaterials as the application. The paradigm and nanoscale metamaterials made via this approach have far-reaching impacts on scalable nanomanufacturing for integrated systems. The paradigm of systems that autonomously evolve parameters to meet construct specifications is extensible to macroscale additive manufacturing and pharmaceuticals where the process parameter space and chemistries available is vast, and design is not intuitive. Additive nanomanufacturing has the potential to transform metamaterial design by enabling design in 3-dimensions (3D) with multiple materials, creating complex composite metastructures."

Little is known about the interactions between patterns and processes in human dominated landscapes, however.  One of the least understood aspects of urban landscape dynamics is the way in which local interactions of humans and biophysical processes generate the landscape patterns of metropolitan regions.  Studying the relationships between these interactions and the resulting urban landscape patterns is critical to plan and manage urban growth in ways that minimize the ecological impacts on ecosystems while sustaining economically and socially viable urban communities.  This research project will examine urban landscapes as emergent phenomena that result from local interactions of human agents, real estate markets, built infrastructure, and biophysical factors like land cover, geomorphology, and natural disturbance regimes to develop a theory of urban landscape dynamics.  The study will employ complex systems, patch dynamics, hierarchical theory, and an agent-based modeling approach to study coupled human-natural dynamics and empirically test this approach in two different bioregions (Seattle and Phoenix).  The models will be developed and used to test hypotheses regarding emergent properties of urban landscapes and to enhance basic understanding of humans-ecological interactions in urban landscapes across scales.  Urban landscapes exhibit some fundamental features of complex self-organizing systems.  They are highly heterogeneous, spatially nested, and hierarchically structured.  The urban spatial structure can be described as a cumulative and aggregate pattern that results from numerous local decisions involving a large number of adaptive agents interacting among themselves and with biophysical factors.  These behaviors eventually can lead to different metropolitan patterns.  This research will address four questions:  (1) How do dynamic landscape systems evolve to generate emergent patterns that are evident in urban landscapes?  (2) What nonlinearities, thresholds, discontinuities, and path dependencies explain divergent trajectories of urban landscapes?  (3) How do emergent urban landscape patterns influence biodiversity and ecosystem functioning?  (4) How can planning integrate this knowledge to develop sustainable urban landscape patterns?  The model implementation will be based on a dynamic probabilistic relational model (DPRM) in which parameters and spatial rules are estimated empirically from two longitudinal land-cover and land-use data sets developed for the Seattle and Phoenix metropolitan areas.<br/><br/>The project will have significant theoretical and practical impacts.  It will develop a better understanding of complex human-ecological dynamics leading to development patterns such as sprawl, one of the most pressing and controversial problem in the United States.  The project will also contribute to advancing biocomplexity science.  The findings of this research will have an impact on both the social and natural sciences particularly the study of development patterns, land-use change, ecological resilience, and public policy in urbanizing regions.  This project will also employ new computational techniques that are of importance to a broad range of disciplines studying human dynamics, ecology, and artificial intelligence.  The findings will also aid planning and management of urban regions by providing simulation tools to assess the ecological impacts and feedback of alternative strategies for urban development and ecological conservation.

It fulfills all aims of the Cyberlearning program -- to imagine, design, and learn how to best design and use the next generation of learning technologies, to address learning issues of national importance, and to contribute to understanding of how people learn."

The research focuses on how to constrain a virtual lab experience to be amenable to automated feedback on relatively open-ended responses students are generating while still giving students an appropriate exploratory experience. The technology innovation question is how to do that with validity and reliability. The team is focusing on how to use available artificial intelligence technologies to make it possible to provide good feedback, both to learners working in these environments and to their teachers. PIs are adding dynamic formative assessment capabilities to  virtual lab experiences that are already extensively used in undergraduate and high-school biology classes.<br/><br/>This is an automated assessment project, focusing on assessing learner understanding and capabilities in situations where learners are exploring, having, and using ideas as they are learning STEM content and practices. There are several ways one could approach automated assessment for situations where learners are acting in a fairly unconstrained way -- design algorithms that can interpret and make inferences from free text, or find ways to design the environment in such a way that learners can explore, develop, and record as needed for deep learning but where they have a more constrained way of expressing themselves or limitations in what they can do that don't constrain the learning or engagement. This project seeks to find a sweet spot -- a happy medium where learners can explore, try things out, have ideas, refine ideas, and use ideas with significant freedom but just enough constraint for already-existing artificial intelligence algorithms to interpret what learners are doing, why they are doing it, and what they mean to express. Learning how to do this is essential to designing the learning environments of the future.<br/><br/>There is broad acknowledgement that more attention must be given in STEM fields to the teaching of higher-order thinking skills, including experimental design, data interpretation and evidence-based judgment. Timely formative assessment is a crucial component of such learning, but formative assessment is impossible for a teacher to do for a whole class of individuals at the time when it will have the most effect (when students are engaging in or have just finished engaging in such activities) and too labor intensive to be done regularly in large high school and introductory-level college classes. This project is therefore developing techniques for automatically providing immediate formative assessment as students are conducting simulation-based experiments and reasoning about their results. The investigation focuses on helping students learn to conduct experiments and interpret results within the discipline of biology; lessons learned will be applicable across STEM domains at the high-school and college levels."

The daily reporting of fraudulent business practices, political chicanery, telemarketing scams, internet predation, and identity theft has only served to reinforce the need for concerted attention to this critical and multifaceted topic. Yet at present there is little coordination of effort among government agencies or in the academic community to address issues related to identification of deception. Moreover, the topic begs for a multidisciplinary approach, so that technical expertise can be integrated with rigorous social science research to derive solutions and detection tools. CITeR-UA addresses these needs by assembling a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional collaboration among researchers and graduate students whose skills and interests intersect with those at CITeR-WVU. <br/><br/>UA is uniquely equipped to lead the deception and credibility aspect of this effort with its state-of-the-art DOD-funded Deception Detection Laboratory for conducting experiments and its Integrated Multimedia System with terabyte server for capturing, editing, storing, and analyzing multimedia data.<br/>"

For example, for electronic skin to meet these expectations, a large number of distributed tactile sensors that are able to stretch and conform to curvilinear objects are required. Moreover, electronics that is conformal to human skin and deform in response to human motion requires stretchability. The functional requirements of stretchable electronics and sensors can be met through nano-enabled technologies, but their successful production requires innovation in scalable manufacturing and integration of processing methods. This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) research project aims to investigate a scalable nanomanufacturing approach to fabricate large-area, high-resolution, stretchable electronics and sensor arrays by heterogeneous integration of metal nanowires and organic semiconductors. The research conducted as part of this award is integrated into interdisciplinary education for the involved students, course curriculum, and K-12 outreach. The project strongly encourages underrepresented students to participate in all aspects of the research.<br/><br/>Advancing the scalable nanomanufacturing of stretchable electronic skin requires: (1) stretchable functional materials (conductors, semiconductors), (2) a manufacturing strategy to integrate heterogeneous nanomaterials into a stretchable platform, and (3) optimal device design and integrated operation capabilities in both electronic and mechanical functionality. To meet these needs, the research investigates metal nanowires and polymer semiconductor material platforms. Stretchable conductors are achieved through forming nanowire-elastomer composites. Printing metal nanowires in large scale with high resolution is challenging. Here nanowire processing focuses on the fundamental understanding of the nanowire ink properties, ink-substrate interactions, and exploration of methods such as gravure and electrohydrodynamic printing. Approaches to achieve high-performance intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors are investigated with a focus on blending conjugated polymers with a secondary polymer matrix. Polymer semiconductor processing focuses on a combination of solution casting and advanced transfer printing methods. Device architecture and integrated manufacturing strategies are optimized to achieve high performance electronic-skin."

Computerized datasets on infectious diseases are currently used for disease reporting, including those developed by various federal, state, and local health, agriculture, and environment/wildlife agencies. However, such datasets are typically not interoperable, particularly in across jurisdiction and across species contexts, reducing their effective use in data modeling and analysis, disease surveillance, and disease management-related decision-making.

More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative, and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less comprehensible and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA) practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services. This project will help close achievement gaps by providing students with adaptive, personalized instruction and also providing teachers with valuable FA techniques, data, and suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create significant commercial value within the educational market. <br/><br/>This project will create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial, the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work, and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus software in the FA loop)."

College students learn about introductory computer literacy or conceptual physics on the web by an intelligent tutoring system, called AutoTutor. AutoTutor helps learners construct explanations that answer difficult questions by interacting with them in natural language and by helping them use simulation environments.  AutoTutor has an animated conversational agent and a dialog management facility that attempts to comprehend the learner's contributions and to respond with appropriate dialog moves (short feedback, pumps, hints, prompts for information, assertions, answers to student questions, suggestions for actions, summaries).  The emotions of the learner are monitored during this learning process by integrating state-of-the-art affect sensing technology with AutoTutor.  Confusion, frustration, boredom, interest, excitement, and other learner emotions are classified on the basis of facial actions, body posture, pressure on the mouse, speech acts in dialog, mastery of the material, and the timing of interactions.  One strand of research develops the affect-sensing technologies and tests their validity in classifying the learner emotions. A second line of research investigates whether learning gains and learner impressions are influenced by dialog moves of AutoTutor that are constrained by the learner's emotional state. <br/><br/>This research will advance education and natural language dialog technologies through a system that promotes deep learning of material in a fashion that is sensitive to the learners' emotions.  A learning environment that monitors learner emotions is likely to be more motivating and personally relevant to the learner.     <br/>"

An emphasis will be placed on using machine learning and computational optimization methods to automate the process of developing efficient Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) for new subject domains. The approach is threefold.<br/>First, a methodology based on hierarchical graphical models and machine learning will be developed and evaluated for automating the creation of student models with rich representations of student state based on data collected from populations of students over multiple tutoring episodes. Second, methods will be developed and evaluated for deriving pedagogical decision strategies that are effective and efficient not just over the short-term (from one math problem to the next one), but over the long-term where retention over a period of at least one month is the objective. Third, a systematic study will be conducted of the role that known and powerful latent and instructional variables can have on performance through their inclusion in student models. Research in cognitive and educational psychology clearly shows the critical role that latent variables such as short-term memory and engagement play in learning, and that instructional variables such as over-learning and review, and massed and distributed practice have on the rate at which material is learned. The investigators jointly have strengths in the areas of intelligent tutoring, machine learning and optimization, and cognitive, mathematical and educational psychology, strengths that are needed in order to make the synergistic advances that are being proposed. Our preliminary simulations and classroom experiments suggest that we can significantly reduce the time it takes students to learn new material based on improved pedagogical decisions.<br/>For intellectual merit, he proposed research should advance fundamental knowledge of the learning and teaching of basic mathematics and more advanced algebra and geometry. It should add to the set of growing statistical and computational techniques that are available to estimate the complex hidden hierarchical structures that govern human behavior. The research should also significantly broaden the capabilities of machine learning systems by addressing learning scenarios that are grounded on the real and challenging problem of mathematics education than the abstract scenarios typically studied at present. For broader impact, this foundational educational research will lead to the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups, especially women, in a variety of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. It will advance discovery and understanding of learning and engagement as predictors of individual differences in learning and will result in intelligent tutors that are more sensitive to individual differences. It will unveil the extent to which students of different genders and cognitive abilities learn more efficiently with different forms of teaching. This research will benefit society as machine learning methods, which provide a core technology for building complex systems, will be applicable to a variety of teaching systems."

Virtual characters participate in nuanced conversations with students, powering a transformational experience for practicing and assessing communication skills.  Rigorous evaluations have demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of teaching perspective-taking and social skills through simulated role-playing, beneficial to students struggling with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or bullying.  These simulations will disrupt the multi-billion dollar market for social emotional learning (SEL) by allowing students to learn and practice social skills as they would with teachers or therapists, but at a fraction of the cost.  Current solutions for practicing and assessing social skills rely on face-to-face interaction, which is costly and difficult to scale.  Producing socially rich, open-ended simulations has previously been infeasible, due to technical challenges required to replicate the complexity of human language.  This project overcomes these barriers using an innovative technology with the potential to revolutionize how people learn and practice social skills by delivering real-time personalized feedback at scale.  Future applications of the social behavior capture (So-Cap) technology that underlies this project range from contextually aware intelligent personal assistants to socially aware robotics.<br/> <br/>This project's unprecedented ability to respond authentically to open-ended natural language input relies on an innovative crowdsourced approach to artificial intelligence (AI), which imbues machines with the ability to understand dialogue in context and engage in extended conversations covering multiple topics.  Individualized responses are tailored to user input by drawing from a massive database of recorded human dialogue, captured from online role-playing.  The process for mining meaningful patterns from this data also employs crowdsourcing, relying on non-experts hired online to cluster and annotate words, utterances, and events.  A computational model formed by these patterns powers a real-time conversational engine, which selects responses by combining AI techniques including plan recognition and case-based planning.  The goal of this research is to pioneer a practical, repeatable process for democratizing the production of social simulations, minimizing cost while maximizing societal impact by providing social skills practice at scale."

Yet despite decades of technological advances in computing and communication media, the fundamentals of oral scientific presentations have not advanced since software such as Microsoft's PowerPoint was introduced in the 1980's.  The PI's goal in this project is to revolutionize media-assisted oral presentations in general, and STEM presentations in particular, through the use of an intelligent, autonomous, life-sized, animated co-presenter agent that collaborates with a human presenter in preparing and delivering his or her talk in front of a live audience.   The PI's pilot studies have demonstrated that audiences are receptive to this concept, and that the technology is especially effective for individuals who are non-native speakers of English (which may be up to 21% of the population of the United States).  Project outcomes will be initially deployed and evaluated in higher education, both as a teaching tool for delivering STEM lectures and as a training tool for students in the sciences to learn how to give more effective oral presentations (which may inspire future generations to engage in careers in the sciences).<br/><br/>This research will be based on a theory of human-agent collaboration, in which the human presenter is monitored using real-time speech and gesture recognition, audience feedback is also monitored, and the agent, presentation media, and human presenter (cued via an intelligent wearable teleprompter) are all dynamically choreographed to maximize audience engagement, communication, and persuasion.  The project will make fundamental, theoretical contributions to models of real-time human-agent collaboration and communication.  It will explore how humans and agents can work together to communicate effectively with a heterogeneous audience using speech, gesture, and a variety of presentation media, amplifying the abilities of scientist-orators who would otherwise be ""flying solo.""  The work will advance both artificial intelligence and computational linguistics, by extending dialogue systems to encompass mixed-initiative, multi-party conversations among co-presenters and their audience.  It will impact the state of the art in virtual agents, by advancing the dynamic generation of hand gestures, prosody, and proxemics for effective public speaking and turn-taking.  And it will also contribute to the field of human-computer interaction, by developing new methods for human presenters to interact with autonomous co-presenter agents and their presentation media, including approaches to cueing human presenters effectively using wearable user interfaces."

This proposal is based upon UMN's successful completion of five years of operation of the SSR-RC; and the commitment by companies to join a research site at the University of Denver. UMN will be the lead research site for SSR-RC with the University of Pennsylvania (joined the Center a few years ago) and the University of Denver as research partners.  <br/> <br/>This proposal covers the renewal for the second-five years of UMN and the expansion to include UD.  The proposed Center will provide integrative robotics, sensing, and artificial intelligence solutions in robotics for activities conducted by the police, FBI, FEMA, transportation safety, and emergency response to mass casualty-related events.  The Center is built upon the knowledge and expertise of multi-disciplinary researchers in computer science, engineering, human factors, and psychology at the three institutions.  The renewed and expanded Center will be successful because it builds on existing strengths developed during the first five years of operation.  The Center will also educate and train researchers for industry and government. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed center is to radically improve homeland defense in all dimensions.  The proposed Center will encourage collaboration, and will nurture an emerging field of research and the associated industries, thus helping to establish the challenges of the field and acceptable research and evaluation methodologies.  SSR-RC will expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects of value to the industry, and plans to attract large companies to the SSR domains and energize innovative start-up companies.  Students will have opportunities for industrial internships with members.

In particular, methods for removing instrumental noise from the LIGO data stream, preparatory to its analysis will be developed.  This work, called ""data conditioning"", is critical to the success of the LIGO since the gravitational wave signals are expected to be weak and would most likely be totally masked by instrumental noise.  Several methods are proposed for conditioning LIGO data including the use of ""artificial intelligence"" tools for time-ordered data.  In addition, LIGO data will be analysed to <br/>1. set upper limits on the gravitational wave strength from known pulsars,<br/>2. search for unanticipated sources of gravitational waves,<br/>3. combine data from the three LIGO detectors synthesized to perform as a single detector.<br/>On technique for identifying gravitational wave signals in the data stream invloves the use of filters designed to pick out a signal with specific characteristics.  Several innovative methods are proposed for the development of non-linear filters in the presence of non-Gaussian noise, involving the use of techniques to determine the most appropriate likelihood function for use when non-normal moments of the data distribution are known."

The project builds on the PIs' prior work, which demonstrated that both teachers and students benefit from such technology because they can easily draw and write on a tablet screens, thus using representations not possible with only a typical keyboard and mouse; and they can easily send such ink inscriptions to one another via wireless connectivity. This communication provides teachers the opportunity to view all the students' work and make decisions about which to share anonymously on a public classroom screen or on every student's screen in order to support discussion in a ""conversation-based"" classroom.  Artificial intelligence methods are used to analyze ink inscriptions in order to facilitate selection and discussion of student work.<br/><br/>The project is a series of design experiments beginning with the software that emerged from earlier exploratory work. The PIs conduct two cycles of experiments to examine how tablets affect students learning in 4th and 5th grade mathematics and science.  The project research questions and methods focus on systematic monitoring of teachers' and students' responses to the innovation in order to inform the development process. The PIs collect data on teachers' and students' use of the technology and on student learning outcomes and use those data as empirical evidence about the promise of the technology for improving STEM education in K-12 schools.  An external evaluator uses parallel data collection, conducting many of the same research activities as the core team and independently providing analysis to be correlated with other data.  His involvement is continuous and provides formative evaluation reports to the project through conferences, site visits, and conference calls.  <br/><br/>The primary products are substantiated research findings on the use of tablet computers, inscriptions, and networks in 4th and 5 grade classrooms.  In addition the PIs develop models for teacher education and use, and demonstrate the utility of artificial intelligence techniques in facilitating use of the technology.  With the addition of Malden Public Schools to the list of participating districts, which includes Cambridge Public Schools and Waltham Public Schools from earlier work, the project expands the field test sites to up 20 schools' classrooms."

Frequently, to search for what is needed, whether images or objects in those images, words are needed instead. Getting accurate labels for efficient searches is a longstanding goal of computer vision, but progress has been slow. This project employs new methods to significantly change how picture-word labeling is accomplished by taking advantage of the best picture recognizer available, the human brain. Through functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, brain activity of humans looking at pictures/videos is recorded and then used to improve performance on artificial intelligence (AI) tasks involving computer vision and natural language processing. Current systems use machine learning to train computers to recognize objects (nouns) and activities (verbs) in images/video, which are then used to describe events. Reasoning tasks (e.g., solving math problems) can then be done. These systems are trained on specially prepared datasets with samples of nouns for objects, verbs for activities, sentences describing events, and exam questions and answers. A novel paradigm using humans to perform the same tasks while their brains are scanned allows determination of neural patterns associated with those tasks. The brain activity patterns, in turn, are used to train better computer systems.<br/><br/>The central hypothesis is that understanding human processing of grounded language involving predication and its use during reasoning will materially improve engineered computer vision, natural language processing, and AI systems that perform image/video captioning, visual question answering, and problem solving.  Scientific and engineering goals include developing models of human language grounding and reasoning consistent with neuroimaging, to improve engineered systems integrating language and vision that support automated reasoning.  The main scientific question is to understand mechanisms by which predicates and arguments are identified, linked, and used for reasoning by the human brain.  The hypothesis, that predicate-argument linking in visual and linguistic representations are accomplished similarly, and that this then supports reasoning and problem solving, will be tested using multiple neuroimaging modalities, and machine learning algorithms to decode ""who did what to whom"" from brain scans of subjects processing linguistic and visual stimuli.  The iterative approach will involve understanding information integration at the neural level, to improve machine learning performance on AI tasks by training computers to perform increasingly complex tasks with neuroimaging data from stimuli derived from large-scale natural tasks.  Using identical datasets for human and machine performance will support translation of scientific advances to engineering practice involving integration of computer vision and natural language processing.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering."
